 * https://leetcode.com/problems/partition-array-into-two-arrays-to-minimize-sum-difference/
 * <p>
 * You are given an integer array nums of 2 * n integers.
 * You need to partition nums into two arrays of length n to minimize the absolute difference of the sums of the arrays.
 * To partition nums, put each element of nums into one of the two arrays.
 * <p>
 * Return the minimum possible absolute difference.
 * <p>
 * Example:
 * Input: nums = [3,9,7,3]
 * Output: 2
 * Explanation: One optimal partition is: [3,9] and [7,3].
 * The absolute difference between the sums of the arrays is abs((3 + 9) - (7 + 3)) = 2.
